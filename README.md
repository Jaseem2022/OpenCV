# OpenCV
This project uses OpenCv and helps to detect the color yellow.
When color yellow is displayed on the camera frame a bounding box is displayed around it.
This project uses packages such as OpenCv, Pillow, and numpy.
For Convienience the logic of program is split into two files, utils.py and main.py.
utils.py contains helper function which helps to determine the upper and lower bound of the bounding box for the particular object shown by the user on to the camera.
main.py is where we execute the code, by setting an option for which camera to be open.
